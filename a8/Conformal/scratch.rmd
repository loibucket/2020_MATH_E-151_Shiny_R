## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#library(combinat)
#permn(0:2)
m = matrix(c(1,2,1,1),nrow=2,ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
start = m
lt = list()
for(i in 1:30){
  start = (start %*% m)%%3
  lt[[i]] <- start
}
unique(lt)
```

```{r}
z = matrix(c(0,0,0,0),nrow=2,ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
z
```



```{r}


```

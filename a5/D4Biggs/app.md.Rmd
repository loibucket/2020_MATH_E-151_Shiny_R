## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
D4.showSquare <- function(cfg){
  par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
  plot(NULL,xlim=c(0,3),ylim = c(-1,2), asp = 1, axes = FALSE)
  points(c(0,0,2,2,0),c(0,2,2,0,0),type = "l", lwd = 2)
  lbl <- strsplit(cfg,"")[[1]]
  s = 0.1
  text(c(0+s,2-s,2-s,0+s),c(0+s,0+s,2-s,2-s),lbl)
}
D4.showSquare("ABCD")
```

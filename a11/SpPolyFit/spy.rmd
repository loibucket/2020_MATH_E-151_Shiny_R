## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
sp = read.csv(file="gspc.csv")
sp$Date <- as.numeric(as.Date(sp$Date , format = "%m/%d/%y"))
x = 1:30
y = sp$Close[(length(sp$Date)-29):length(sp$Date)]
x = 1:30
length(x)
y
length(y)
y = sp$Close[(length(sp$Date)-29):length(sp$Date)]
y
```
